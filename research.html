<h3> <a href= "http://cdn.f1000.com/posters/docs/262543943"> A preliminary study of quantitative temporal modeling of the urge to
blink during blink suppression </a></h3> Elizabeth Torres Claudio
, William Kevin Black

, Cheryl Richards, PhD
, Kevin J. Black, MD
  <p class="lead">The objective of this study was to analyze variability within and between subjects
on the time courses of discomfort and effort needed
during blink suppression until a blink occurred and
until the time allocated for the trial had elapsed. After the study was completed, the study reveled that subjects did blink occasionally during the blink
suppression period (Table 3), presumably to
decrease the discomfort and/or effort.  On average, subjects rated peak discomfort and
effort as moderate in intensity (Figure 6). These preliminary results suggests that line
segments or exponential curves could be used to
model the discomfort and effort during the blink
suppression and free blinking periods (Torres et. al.). </p> <br> 
<h3> <a href= "http://f1000research.com/articles/2-207/v1"> A pilot study of basal ganglia and thalamus structure by high dimensional mapping in children with Tourette syndrome </a> </h3> <p> Alton C. Williams, Marie E. McNeely, Deanna J. Greene, Jessica A. Church, Stacie L. Warren, Johanna M. Hartlein, Bradley L. Schlaggar, Kevin J. Black, Lei Wang </p> 
          <p class="lead">In this pilot study, T1-weighted MRIs were collected in 13 children with TS and 16 healthy, tic-free, control children. The groups were well matched for age.  The primary outcome measures were the first 10 eigenvectors which are derived using HDBM-LD methods and represent the majority of the geometric shape of each structure, and the volumes of each structure adjusted for whole brain volume. We also compared hemispheric right/left asymmetry and estimated effect sizes for both volume and shape differences between groups. The results showed that there werw no statistically significant differences between the TS subjects and controls in volume, shape, or right/left asymmetry.  Effect sizes were greater for shape analysis than for volume (Williams et. al.). </p>
 <h3> <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110735?dopt=Citation"> Cognitive-pharmacologic functional magnetic resonance imaging in tourette syndrome: a pilot study </a> </h3> <p> Hershey T1, Black KJ, Hartlein JM, Barch DM, Braver TS, Carl JL, Perlmutter JS. </p> 
          <p class="lead">In this study, the study obtained complete fMRI data in 8 neuroleptic-naive adults with a chronic tic disorder and in 10 well-matched tic-free control subjects. The results are consistent with a dopamine-influenced functional abnormality of brain response in TS and suggest testable hypotheses about the mechanism by which dopamine antagonists and agonists alleviate tics (Hershey et al.).</p> 

 <h3> <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17289354?dopt=Abstract"> Validity of large-deformation high dimensional brain mapping of the thalamus and basal ganglia in adults with Tourette syndrome.  </a> </h3> <p> Wang L, Lee DY, Bailey E, Hartlein J, Gado M, Miller MI, Black KJ</p> 
          <p class="lead">In this study, T1-weighted MR scans were collected in 15 neuroleptic-na√Øve adults with TS or chronic motor tics and 15 healthy, tic-free adult subjects matched for age, gender and handedness. We demonstrated the validity and reliability of large-deformation high dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD) as a tool to characterize the basal ganglia (caudate, globus pallidus and putamen) and thalamus. We found no significant volume or shape differences in any of the structures in this small sample of subjects (Wang et al.).</p>
