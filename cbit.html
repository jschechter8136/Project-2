  <h3 class = "under"> About </h3> 
          <p class="lead">Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)  is a behavior therapy treatment for tics. CBIT qualifies as a "well-established" treatment for TS under American Psychological Association guidelines (Chambless et al., 1998; Cook & Blacher, 2007) and is recommended by several experts as the first treatment for many TS patients (Verdellen et al., 2011; Steeves et al., 2012; Leckman, 2014). Substantial reduction in tics often seen after first session and careful observation shows no evidence of substitution of one tic for another, and treatment effects are observed both at home and in the clinic (Kevin Black, M.D.).

<h3 class = "under"> What to Expect </h3> 
  <p class="lead">There are 4 main components to CBIT that you will experience during the behavioral therapy: awareness training, relaxation training, competing response training, and contingency management. <br> <br> 

During awareness training, you will  describe the detail of each tic to therapist, using mirror and/or videotape and you will practice self-detection of earliest signs or sensory cues before a tic. In addition, you will identify situations, persons or places in which symptoms were better or worse. As homework, you will be instructed to record the frequency of each tic for a specified duration each day (10min or all day depending on frequency of tic). These procedures will help you to increase your awareness of your tics. <br> <br> 

During relaxation training, you will practice various relaxation methods such as progressive muscular relaxation, deep breathing, visual imagery, and self-statements of relaxation. You will be taught these methods during your first visit and instructed to practice at least daily for 10-15 minutes as well as for 1-2 minutes whenever you are anxious or whenever you have a tic. 

<br> <br> 
During competing response training, you will be taught a specific response pattern that would be incompatible with the tic. This response will be socially inconspicuous and easily compatible with normal ongoing activities. For example,  for a tic which involves the head jerking back, the competing responce could be contraction of the neck flexors with chin slightly down and in.
